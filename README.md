Image Segmentation using K-Means
This project demonstrates image segmentation using the K-Means algorithm. The goal of image segmentation is to partition an image into multiple segments, each of which corresponds to a different object or part of the scene. K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that can be used to segment images by grouping similar pixels together.
